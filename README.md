If you would like to pull the project down:

***Requirement: the only requirement is a web app. I prefer to use lite-server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server). It is an amazing development only server.  

You will need to clone the project into your favorite folder
Afterwards, navigate through terminal into the clockSpecialtyClient folder and run the 'lite-server' command. This should bring up the server in your browser.
